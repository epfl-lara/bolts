# Terverak

Terverak is a card game developed as a bachelor project by Bastien Jolidon & Kelvin Kappeler.
You can play the game on [terverak](https://github.com/KelvinKappeler/Terverak).

Here is only the game model that has been verified by Stainless.

Some VCs will not pass using the basic solver (z3). You need to install cvc4 solver in order to pass them.

Currently, 3 VCs do not pass out of the 968 proposed.
