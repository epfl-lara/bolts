# Bolts: Stainless Verified Scala

This repository showcases additional examples of code verified using
[Stainless](https://stainless.epfl.ch) system for Scala. The benchmarks
executed from [run-tests.sh](run-tests.sh) should run correctly with a 
recent [the main branch of Stainless](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/) and most are [in this file](tctests.txt).

Some highlights:
  * [Verified Quite OK Image Format](qoi)
  * [Verified data structures](data-structures), mostly functional ones
  * [Various verified algorithms of varrying complexity](algorithms)
  * [Functional Programming Principles](fp-principles), inspired by some of the Scala course labs
  * [Software foundations](software-foundations), inspired by the Software foundations book
  * [Expression Compiler](expression-compiler), correctness of an expression compiler
  * [Examples from lectures and tutorials](tutorials) may be helpful
